(Original reconstruction. The model is sourced from yeast 8.3.4 (at https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM) and then is reformatted to the format in another yeast model (at https://github.com/maranasgroup/iRhto_memote) plus additional curations and fixes.)<br>

(Further important updates to the model's growth and non-growth associated ATP maintenance (i.e., GAM and NGAM) parameters have been added.)<br>

#### Features
* Reactions and metabolites' IDs are in BiGG format
* Simplified lipid metabolism: modeling lipid species with average acyl-group representation rather than listing all specific lipid species containing combinations of acyl groups of different chain lengths.
* Updated and reformatted biomass reaction (see ./resources/)
* Content curations and fixes (see ./change_log/\*)
* Condition-specific GAM and NGAM values derived from experimental data for: (i) Batch, anaerobic, (ii) C-lim, anaerobic, (iii) Batch and C-lim, aerobic, (iv) N-lim and aerobic
