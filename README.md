# *iSace*1144 - A genome-scale metabolic model of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
This repository provides resources and model files for the genome-scale model *iSace*1144 that accompanies the manuscript "Title".<br>

The model is sourced from yeast 8.3.4 (at https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM) and then is reformatted to the format in another yeast model (at https://github.com/maranasgroup/iRhto_memote) plus additional curations and fixes.<br>

#### Features
* Reactions and metabolites' IDs are in BiGG format
* Simplified lipid metabolism: modeling lipid species with average acyl-group representation rather than listing all specific lipid species containing combinations of acyl groups of different chain lengths.
* Updated and reformatted biomass reaction (see ./resources/iSace_biomass_formulation.xlsx)
* Content curations and fixes (see ./change_log/\*)
